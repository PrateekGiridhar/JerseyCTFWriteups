<h1>Challenge Text</h1>

On the first day of the job, a new cryptography intern is insisting to upper management that he developed a new encryption algorithm for the company to use for sensitive emails and should get a raise. 
This seems too good to be true... are you able to prove the intern wrong by decrypting it?

Here's an example of an encrypted email message using the intern's algorithm: amN0Znt0UllfQUVTX0lOc1QzQGR9

<h1>Hint</h1>

What are some differences between encryption, encoding, and hashing?

<h1>Solution</h1>

Recognize the usage of Base64 encoding and copy the text into a Base64 decoder:

Flag: jctf{tRY_AES_INsT3@d}
